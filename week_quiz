         8
longest leaf length is 3, from 4-6, 6-7, 7-8

                     3(2)
      1(0-1+(-0)=-1)     4(0-1+(-2)=-3)
           2(0)             6(0-(-1)+(--2)=2)
                       5(0)    7(0-1=-1)
                                   8(0)
balance factor = height of left subtree - height of right subtree
start at bottom with 0, and then work upwards

                                             4(1-1+(-2)=-2)
                             3(1-0+(--1)=2)                    5(0)
               1(0-1+(-0)=-1)  
                      2(0)
node 3 is the one with the balance factor of 2 or greater

4. to make binary tree into avl tree, we do rotation:
                      balance factor of the lowest point of imbalance               balance factor of the node in the direction of imbalance
left rotation         2		                                                    1
right rotation        -2                                                            -1
left right rotation   2                                                             -1
right left rotation   -2                                                             1
balanced BST are height balanced trees that ensure nearly half of the data is located in each sub-tree
mountain, stick
deepest node of of balance
make stick into mountain

generic left rotation:
b                c
 c              b  d
  d
rotations essentially turn an imbalanced tree into a balanced tree, while preserving the order.

out of balance means balance foctor of >|1|

generic right left rotation:
b     b       d 
  c    d     b c
 d      c
this enables following data to be inserted while preserving the balance, hence bst tree -> avl tree

for 3, do a generic left right rotation starting at node3:
that means left rotate at the bottom 2 nodes, right rotate at the top 2 nodes
   3      3      2
 1       2      1  3
  2     1
is this right?
this gives:
     4
   2   5
  1 3
yeah it's right

this method can be used for organization of groups of people.

avl insert:
1. insert at proper place
2. check for imbalance
3. rotate of necessary
4. update height
